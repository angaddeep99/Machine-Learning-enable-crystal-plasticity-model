Fatigue is a complicated process involving inelastic deformation and formation of cracks. The Crack initiation process entails about eighty percent of the useful lifetime of a material and still experimental prediction of crack initiation remains a tedious task. Granular microstructural features play a crucial role in determining the locations of crack initiation, hence it becomes quite important to understand the different mesoscale structural properties that can help us to design materials in a way to delay crack initiations. Several crystal plasticity models have been trying to understand the different mechanisms involved in fatigue deformation, but the issue with them is the extensive requirement of computational resources. 
Recent developments in machine learning have shown promising results in this direction. Several machine learning models have been built to correlate microstructural features with mechanical properties like tensile strength and toughness. However, no major research has been done to use machine learning for predicting crack initiation under fatigue cycles.
